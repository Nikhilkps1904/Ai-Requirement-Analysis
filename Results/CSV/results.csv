Requirement_1,Requirement_2,Conflict_Type,Conflict_Reason
Fuel efficiency of at least 60 km/l for petrol engines,Anti-lock braking system (ABS) for improved stopping power,Performance Conflict,"Achieving 60 km/l fuel efficiency may require design choices that compromise braking system weight and performance, potentially hindering the effectiveness of ABS."
Fuel efficiency of at least 60 km/l for petrol engines,Top speed of at least 100 km/h for versatility,Performance Conflict,Achieving high fuel efficiency (60 km/l) often requires design compromises that negatively impact top speed.
Fuel efficiency of at least 60 km/l for petrol engines,Seat height adjustable between 750-850 mm for rider comfort,Performance Conflict,Achieving 60 km/l fuel efficiency may necessitate design choices that compromise rider comfort features like seat adjustability within the specified range.
Fuel efficiency of at least 60 km/l for petrol engines,Digital dashboard with smartphone connectivity,Performance Conflict,Achieving 60 km/l fuel efficiency in petrol engines may necessitate design choices that conflict with the added weight and power consumption of a digital dashboard with smartphone connectivity.
Fuel efficiency of at least 60 km/l for petrol engines,Front and rear disc brakes for reliable performance,Performance Conflict,"Achieving 60 km/l fuel efficiency may require design compromises that negatively impact braking system weight and performance, making it difficult to simultaneously implement high-performance front and rear disc brakes."
Fuel efficiency of at least 60 km/l for petrol engines,Annual maintenance cost below $120,Cost Conflict,"Achieving high fuel efficiency (60 km/l) often requires advanced engine technology, increasing manufacturing and maintenance costs, potentially exceeding the $120 annual maintenance budget."
Fuel efficiency of at least 60 km/l for petrol engines,Lightweight frame under 150 kg for better handling,Performance Conflict,"Achieving high fuel efficiency (60 km/l) often requires heavier components and technologies, conflicting with the lightweight frame requirement (under 150 kg)."
Fuel efficiency of at least 60 km/l for petrol engines,"Compliance with global emission standards (e.g., BS6 or Euro 5)",Performance Conflict,Achieving 60 km/l fuel efficiency may necessitate design compromises that hinder compliance with stringent emission standards.
