-----|--------------------|-------------
The vehicle's fuel efficiency and manual headlight are not in conflict, so no immediate sustainable conflict has been identified based on the requirements provided. However, it's worth noting that operating the headlights would consume energy and potentially diminish the fuel efficiency to some extent. To minimize this effect, the vehicle may include an energy-efficient lighting system (e.g. LED) and an automatic light-sensing feature which turns on the headlights when necessary, thereby reducing the need for manual activation. This would also be more user-friendly, since manual headlight activation might be unnecessary in most situations.

The engine should have a minimum power output of 25 HP.,The engine should have a fuel injection system for optimized combustion.,Other,Compliance Conflict,"Resolution_Suggestion

Conflict_Reason: Fuel injection systems are typically found on engines with more advanced technology and higher power outputs, but the provided requirement for a minimum power output of 25 HP does not specify a modern technology requirement for this. Therefore, seeking engines with fuel injection systems may lead to exceeding the specified minimum power output.

To ensure both requirements are met, consider the following options:

1. Revise Requirement 1 to set a minimum power output for modern engines with fuel injection systems (e.g., a minimum power output for turbocharged 4-cylinder engines with fuel injection).

2. Revise Requirement 2 to state a preference for fuel injection, allowing for alternatives as long as they meet the minimum power requirement (e.g., carburetor technology).

3. Research engines capable of meeting the 25 HP requirement with fuel injection. This might require finding older models with well-tuned carburetors or specialized engines designed to be efficient without advanced technology.",Compliance Conflict

For the fuel injection system, it might be possible to opt for a simpler and less expensive design that still provides optimal combustion, such as a carburetor.

The vehicle should support smart connectivity via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.,The wheels should be spoked to maintain classic aesthetics.,Other,Regulatory Conflict,"Resolution_Suggestion

The conflict here may arise due to regulatory or safety issues. While smart connectivity features (i.e., Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) are common and supported by most vehicular standards, the use of spoked wheels may conflict with some safety regulations. For instance, the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) in the US require that wheels maintain a certain level of integrity and structural rigidity. The spoked wheel design, while iconic, may not meet these requirements, potentially leading to safety concerns.

To resolve this issue, it would be advisable to conduct an in-depth analysis of the specific safety standards applicable to the vehicle and its components (including wheels) in the targeted market(s). If necessary, consider designing a hybrid solution where the functional benefits of smart connectivity are maintained while integrating spoked wheels that are compliant with relevant safety standards.

The minimalistic dashboard design requirement (Requirement 1) and the durability requirement for at least 10 years of use (Requirement 2) do not inherently create conflicts. A minimalistic dashboard can be designed with high-quality, durable materials that are sustainably engineered, ensuring both user-centric design aesthetics and longevity. It's crucial that the vehicle's design process includes coordination between the design, engineering, and materials selection teams to ensure that the minimalistic dashboard meets both the desired aesthetic and the durability requirements. Moreover, ongoing monitoring, testing, and potential updates throughout the product lifecycle can assure that durability standards are met and maintained over the 10-year usage period.

Implementing these checks might interfere with the bike's classic appearance, as it may require additional electronics near or within the wheels to monitor their condition during updates.

To resolve this conflict, it might be beneficial to explore safety-focused OTA update mechanisms that minimize the need for intrusive hardware. Examples could include:

- Battery life and temperature monitoring: This could be used to prevent software updates during periods of sustained use or extreme environmental conditions that might impact the bike's operation.
- OTA update tests during periods of inactivity: The bike could be programmed to update during breaks in use, such as overnight, to minimize disruptions to the classic aesthetics.

The onboard computer should be minimal to reduce electronic dependencies.,Production costs should remain below market average for affordability.,Other,"Conflict_Reason: The desire for a minimal onboard computer conflicts with the need for production costs to remain below market average, as a minimal onboard computer might require more expensive components to ensure it meets all necessary functional requirements.","Resolution_Suggestion: To resolve this conflict, explore alternative, less expensive components that can still meet the functional requirements of a minimal onboard computer. Additionally, consider optimizing software to run efficiently on the chosen components, reducing the need for additional, costly hardware.",Resource Conflict

The vehicle should have a minimalistic dashboard design.,The vehicle must include a high-capacity battery for extended electric range.,Other,Resource Conflict,"Resolution_Suggestion

The incorporation of a minimalistic dashboard (Requirement 1) is designed to optimize user interface space, while including a high-capacity battery (Requirement 2) for extended electric range concerns the optimization of physical space within the vehicle for the battery system. This potential conflict stems from the limited space available within a vehicle chassis, which must accommodate both the dashboard components and the high-capacity battery. To resolve this conflict, the vehicle's design team could opt for innovative solutions such as integrating the battery system into the vehicle floor or seating, or using sleek and compact dashboard displays that require minimal physical space without compromising functionality.",Resource Conflict
The wheels should be spoked to maintain classic aesthetics.,The braking system should use ABS for enhanced safety.,Other,"The conflict potentially arises due to a difference in design requirements. Spoked wheels are traditionally lighter and more aesthetically pleasing but may not provide the same stopping power and consistency as wheel designs typically used with ABS braking systems. To resolve this conflict, consider using ABS technology compatible with spoked wheels or investigating performance-enhanced spoked wheel designs.",Requires manual review,Performance Conflict

The braking system should use ABS for enhanced safety.,The instrument cluster should use analog dials to reduce complexity.,Other,Material Conflict,"Resolution_Suggestion
A control system that requires digital and electronic components (ABS) conflicts with an instrument cluster that requires analog components (Analog dials). To resolve this conflict, a hybrid solution could be considered where some parts of the instrument cluster are digital while the rest remains analog. This would allow the use of ABS while also reducing overall complexity.",Material Conflict

The bike should support over-the-air (OTA) software updates.,The wheels should be spoked to maintain classic aesthetics.,Other,"The OTA software updates require a wireless connection and a compatible electronics system, while spoked wheels are traditional mechanical components without such capabilities. Resolution_Suggestion: Integrate a wireless module inside the bike, potentially in the frame or wheels, while ensuring that the modern electronics system does not compromise the classic aesthetics of the spoked wheels. This could involve using wireless modules with minimal size and camouflaging them effectively to blend with the rest of the bike components.",Requires manual review,Technology Conflict
