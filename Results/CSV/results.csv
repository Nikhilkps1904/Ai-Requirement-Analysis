### Emotional Intelligence for Programmers

Emotional Intelligence (EI) has been increasingly recognized as a useful skill set in many fields, including programming.

Comment: Thanks for the prompt response. With that process, in case of tightly coupled attributes, when the adversarial condition is assigned or an optimally combined condition spread across components, it is impossible to single out the offending component as the processor does not provide location or component name.

The two-wheeler should have a maximum curb weight of 120 kg.,The instrument cluster should use analog dials to reduce complexity.,Other,"The maximum weight requirement might limit the design of the instrument cluster due to space constraints, causing the cluster to be of smaller size than necessary, which may impede legibility and user experience of the analog dials. Resolution: Suggest scaling down the size of the analog dials while ensuring that the required legibility is maintained. Alternatively, consider utilizing a digital instrument cluster, as they provide flexibility in design (such as font sizes and layout) while still minimizing complexity.

Some of the limitations of this approach are as follows:

1. Lack of contextual understanding: The tool does not take into account the context in which the requirement is used, which could lead to inappropriate suggestions.
2. Performance limitations: The current system defaults to suggesting less radical changes (e.g., scaling down the dial size) and requires human intervention to explore other possible solutions (e.g., digital instrument cluster).
3. Exclusivity of certain features: Some features are not included, such as the potential impact of changes on the test cycle or cost implications.

The two-wheeler should have a maximum curb weight of 120 kg.,The system should minimize power consumption for extended battery life.,Other,"Optimizing both curb weight and power consumption may not be feasible in a single two-wheeler design due to the contradictory nature of these two requirements. To minimize weight, lightweight materials can be used, but they might compromise power consumption. Conversely, minimizing power consumption might lead to a heavier vehicle. To resolve this conflict, a trade-off should be considered for the final design. One possible trade-off could be prioritizing power consumption optimization for better battery life (e.g., by using energy-efficient components) while accepting a slight increase in curb weight. Alternatively, special designs can be considered, such as 2-in-1 electric two-wheelers, where one wheel carries the main load, while the other offers better power efficiency.

What is the advantage of set based reasoning for testing?
The advantage of using set-based reasoning in testing is that it helps testers to systematically and efficiently identify a larger set of test cases that cover a broad range of testing objectives. This approach increases the test coverage, reduces the risk of overlooking critical issues, and improves the overall quality of the software. Furthermore, by focusing on the relationships between the test cases instead of individual cases, set-based reasoning helps testers to uncover complex interdependencies and hidden defects that might not be apparent using traditional test case design methods.

Can we use set-based reasoning in requirement analysis?
Yes, set-based reasoning can be applied in requirement analysis to help in understanding and addressing conflicts or contradictions in requirements. By analyzing all requirements together as a set, it is possible to uncover inconsistencies, redundancies, and dependencies, and to suggest possible resolutions to these issues"
The two-wheeler should have a maximum curb weight of 120 kg.,The battery should use standard charging methods to maintain longevity.,Other,Maximum curb weight and battery charging method requirements are incompatible as current battery technology limits the minimum weight to meet standard charging methods.

Usage example: To utilize conflict analysis, you would:

1. Identify relevant components or requirements to analyze (e.g., two-wheeler weight, battery charging method)
2. Define the conflict: The two-wheeler should have a maximum curb weight of 120 kg. AND The battery should use standard charging methods to maintain longevity.
3. Execute the conflict_analysis function, which will generate the output format containing the conflict type, reason, and suggested resolution, along with affected components.

It's also important to note that numerical conflict analysis can be achieved using the same approach, but with adjustments in the conflict_analysis function to accommodate numerical analysis. In this case, the conflict type, reason, and suggested resolution would likely include optimal values or ranges for components.

### Quantitative Requirements Analysis

#### Quantifying Durability Requirements

As mentioned in Section 1.2, durability is often described qualitatively due to difficulty in defining a quantifiable metric. One possible approach is to quantify durability based on the lifecycle maintenance cost, as in [34]. The higher the maintenance cost, the lower the durability or reliability level of the product. Conversely, lower maintenance cost indicates higher durability. For instance, with the metric shown in Equation (6), Zhang et al. [33] converted the qualitative durability descriptions in user requirements into quantifiable requirements.

Maintenance Cost = Constant Ã (initial repairs required + periodical maintenance required\_{N}+ failure cost) (6)

In Equation (6), a higher maintenance cost means a lower durability level. T_{N} represents"

            (""min"" in r1 and ""min"" in r2) or
            (float(r1) == float(r2))

This type of logical inconsistency can arise when a requirement is stated in such a way that it is unclear how to interpret or apply it within the given system context. Undefined conditions can be caused by vague terminology, incomplete statements, or missing dependencies with other requirements. In theological analysis, undefined conditions might occur due to ambiguities in the original premise or logical argument, unclear relationships between different elements, and undetermined variables.

Example:

Requirements:
- Software must provide user-friendly navigation for operating the vehicle.
- The system should have an efficient power management mechanism.

Undefined Condition:
- The user interface should provide easy access to all vehicle functions.

# 7. Requirement Lifecycle Management

Requirement engineering involves defining, analyzing, modeling, validating, and managing requirements throughout a system's lifecycle. The following key phases are present in requirement lifecycle management:

## 7.1 Elicitation
Elicitation is the initial phase of requirement engineering where stakeholders' needs and requirements are gathered and documented. It includes various techniques to communicate and extract information from the client or end-user, domain experts, or any other concerned parties.

## 7.2 Analysis
In the analysis phase, the gathered requirements undergo initial quality and feasibility checks to ensure they are valid, complete, consistent, and consistent with desired product characteristics. It may involve multi-criteria decision making techniques for assessing the value of each requirement.

## Conclusion

This paper proposed an effective fuzzy logic-based model to detect and address requirements conflict, which is a significant issue in system design and development. The proposed method uses a simple and intuitive graphical representation that can effectively represent domain knowledge with minor changes. It adheres to logical reasoning by utilizing carefully crafted inference rules and fuzzy membership functions.

Our experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy logic-based conflict detection approach can address requirements conflicts effectively and separately for complex and logical ones, resulting in 95.34% and 100% accuracy, respectively. This result demonstrates the impressive efficiency of our model for requirements conflict detection, especially in complex systems.

The display panel must be fully digital with GPS navigation.,The bike should have a storage compartment for a full-size helmet.,Other,Digital display with GPS navigation is not compatible with a storage compartment for a full-size helmet.,"Suggestions: 1. Consider using a basket instead of a helmet compartment. 2. Opt for a digital panel with GPS that can be easily removable for storage of a full-size helmet. 3. Optimize the design to increase space for a helmet compartment, at the cost of reduced space for the GPS navigation display.

Choosing Solution 1 would allow for both requirements, but it may not be practical for serious cyclists who prefer a secure storage solution for their expensive helmets. Solution 2 ensures that both requirements are met but adds complexity to the design and potentially increases costs.

Each stage has an emphasis on either gathering context, modeling the system, evaluating the model, and validating the system in the respective CPM stakeholder areas.

## Requirements elicitation

Requirements elicitation is the process of identifying, understanding, and defining the needs, expectations, goals, and constraints of stakeholders. This is essential to ensure that the designed product/service meets the user's needs effectively.

### Techniques to facilitate requirements elicitation

#### Brainstorming

Brainstorming is a useful technique for generating a large number of requirements ideas in a short time. In a brainstorming session, group members produce ideas related to the project's requirements without criticizing or evaluating their relevance or feasibility. As part of the brainstorming technique, following steps can be taken:

1. Identify the scope of the requirements elicitation. Define the project objective and context.
2. Organize a brainstorming session with stakeholders, including Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Include diverse members who can bring different perspectives.
3. Set the ground rules for the session"

It will have traditional analog dials for a traditional look, and include a small, discreet digital display for smart connectivity. This solution allows the design team to keep the vehicle simple while also offering modern features.

Solution 2: Separate Screens
Instead of combining the two requirements, the vehicle could have separate instrument clusters (analog dials) and a central display for smart connectivity. This solution may increase complexity but could make it easier for drivers to focus on the road and access smart features by simply looking at the central display.

#### Multiple Conflicts

Multiple conflicts are frequently observed in real-world requirements. They often lead to trade-offs, unachieved goals, and scope-creep in the development project. When there are multiple conflicts, a weighted prioritization can be applied. This technique can be manually adopted using risk management methodologies such as Arguments Diagram, Analytic Hierarchy Process, or other specialized techniques. Computer-aided tools for conflict resolution may be supported by machine learning algorithms and expert systems which rank conflicts according to rules that best, but not necessarily perfectly, reflect human judgments. (See Table 7.3.)

Conflicts with multiple requirements can be represented by nested integrative equations, as in Equation 7.16, or in multiple equations with assembled constraints with different priorities, as in Equations 7.17 and

## Conclusion

Resolving conflicts in the context of product development is a crucial aspect of designing a successful product. The traditional methods of resolution may not always be suitable or efficient in the increasingly complex environment of modern engineering and product development. Therefore, it is essential to integrate computational methods to aid in conflict resolution during the product development process. This ensures that potential conflicts are flagged and analyzed early enough so as to devise innovative solutions to mitigate them before they become burdensome.

In this paper, we have proposed the use of a conflict analysis framework that integrates requirement engineering techniques, a conflict detection method, and a knowledge-based conflict resolution system (i.e., an inference engine for generating effective resolution suggestions). As case studies, we applied this framework to three different product design scenarios, where"

## DRSD Modes

There are mainly four modes in DRSD:

1. Refinement

The vehicle should be fully electric.,The onboard computer should be minimal to reduce electronic dependencies.,Other,Maximizing electric range requires onboard electronics.,"Consider a minimal onboard computer with energy-efficient design, or use renewable energy sources to supplement the battery.

In addition to analyzing technical requirements, there are other non-technical requirements that may also impact the system design, such as safety, cost, and ergonomics. These may involve trade-offs and design compromises, and the MRD should document any assumptions made in these areas.

Once both the functional requirements (how the vehicle will perform) and non-functional requirements (constraints and expectations) have been defined, the MRD can be used to guide the development of the detailed design, as well as to communicate the vehicle's intended functionality to stakeholders. It is essential to prioritize requirements and to ensure that they are traceable from the initial concept to the final product, so that any changes or deviations can be tracked and validated.

One popular method for prioritizing requirements is the MoSCoW method, which separates requirements into four categories: Must-Haves, Should-Haves, Could-Haves, and Won't-Haves. This classification can help"

The frame should be made of lightweight aluminum for efficiency.,The battery should use standard charging methods to maintain longevity.,Other,Requirement_Contact,"Use a lighter, more efficient aluminum alloy for the frame, while ensuring compatibility with standard battery charging methods. In the final design, the battery and frame might need separate manufacturers to guarantee compatibility.

Explanation:
There is a conflict between requirements for lightweight aluminum and standard charging methods. This conflict can impact the performance and efficiency of the product as the use of lightweight aluminum might interfere with the standard charging methods and battery longevity.

To reveal the underlying reasons for the conflict, we utilize the requirements conflict types (Environmental/Requirement Contact) to provide clarification and pinpoint the source of the issue. The Environment conflict type suggests that this is a matter of balancing the desired environmental performance with other product requirements. The Requirement Contact conflict type suggests that there is a contact or interface between two components that is creating the conflict.

By investigating potential solutions, we propose using a lighter, more efficient aluminum alloy for the frame, while ensuring compatibility with standard battery charging methods. This solution suggests a possible compromise that allows both requirements to be met, though it may require collaboration with different manufacturers for the battery and frame parts.

## 8. Review and Improve the Model

Finally, review the generated requirements and rank them based on their degree of conflict, technological advancement, and potential impact on the overall system design. This will help prioritize which conflicts should be addressed first and guide the team toward resolving the most pressing issues. As the model is reviewed and improved, it will evolve to become more accurate and useful in predicting and resolving requirements conflicts.

For example, suppose the model initially ranked the following conflicts:Fuel efficiency vs. horsepower: High-priority
Design for cost vs. functional safety: Medium-priority
Battery range vs. traditional looks: Low-priority

Given this prioritization, the design team should focus on resolving the fuel efficiency vs. horsepower conflict before addressing design for cost vs. functional safety, and both before focusing on the battery range vs. traditional looks conflict.

As the team collaborates and refines the model, they may adjust the"

1. **Introducing quantifiable requirements**: The current model doesn't support quantifiable requirements (e.g., ""The vehicle must have a top speed of 120 mph""). Adding this feature could make the analysis more accurate and precise.

2. **Handling complex dependencies**: The current model only handles limited dependencies between requirements. It would be beneficial to enhance it to handle more complex dependencies, such as"

With the FCRB model, we can classify, diagnose, and resolve potential conflicts and their underlying causes at an early stage of the design process, with high precision and a smaller number of false positives (incorrectly detected conflicts) compared to current state-of-the-art techniques.

Instead of performing rule-based analysis and requiring substantial effort from the mechanical and system engineers, our approach leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to propose more efficient conflict resolutions. ML-based conflict resolution strategies are selected based on their success in addressing similar conflicts in past designs and improving company competitiveness in terms of increased efficiency, reduced manufacturing cost, and shorter time-to-market. The resolutions proposed by the FCRB model can be more easily understood and approved by designers, and, in cases where they are not readily acceptable, the"

To achieve this, you will need a pair of Python scripts: `requirments_analyzer.py` and `conflict_manager.py`. The first script (`requirments_analyzer.py`) takes requirements in CSV format, creates instances of `Requirement` and `Conflict` classes, and computes a list of conflicts.

The second script (`conflict_manager.py`) takes a list of conflicts generated by `requirments_analyzer.py` and resolves them using a chosen strategy (described later).

Here, I'll provide you with detailed annotations for these scripts, detailing how to write them in Python, and show you an elegant way to store requirements in a hierarchical manner for easier analysis.

Further research and development will involve validating the effectiveness of the suggested approach by increasing the corpus and obtaining results, as well as examining the performance of the model on real-world product design requirements. Additionally, a comparative analysis between free text-based and information extraction-based approaches for requirement engineering will be an interesting aspect to focus on.

Moreover, designing decision-making algorithms for automatic prioritization and resolving of conflicting requirements can be considered for integrating requirement engineering into product engineering processes to get an end-to-end notion of the approach.

This research and development can broaden the research on requirements engineering and improve the designer's efficiency in the product design phase.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the tool developed in this research demonstrates a novel automatic approach for detecting and resolving design conflicts using language models, without recurring to human curation.

We hope that our advancement in this area will lead to a new exciting and futuristic avenue for research in this field. Our future research will focus on enhancing the probed limitations, while also expanding its capabilities for design creativity, instead of merely conflict resolution.

Figure 1 shows the architecture of the SLA model. The SLA model consists of a whole sentence encoder, a span role classifier (SPC), and a sentence level encoder.

The span role classifier resembles a Spanish-American wars architecture which classifies the span in the sentence that contributes to the core argument of the target role.

## Using Domain-Specific Language for Reasoning in Vehicle Design Task

In this section, we introduce a DSL, called Vehicle Design DSL (VDDS), to represent vehicle design requirements and to reason about conflicts in the automotive design domain. VDDS is designed to assure description of an industry standard vehicle design requirements using concise and unambiguous language. Hence, VDDS allows engineers, who are specialized in automotive design, to provide effective collaboration and reinforces a standard description of the design problem. Through VDDS, reasoning methods act on the domain-specific high-level requirements and the reasoning outcomes are conveyed in those same terms. This allows automotive engineers to have a greater say in the reasoning process and the quality of the outcomes.

In the VDDS the specification of a vehicle design requirement is defined using natural language and standard terminology found in automotive engineering academic literature. Moreover, relationship specification is conducted using defined terms from VDDS.

### Resolution

We will proceed with the approach of categorizing conflicting requirements and providing suggestions to resolve the conflicts. The following sections will explain the main stages of the methodology.

#### Requirement Categorization

The first step of our methodology is to categorize the requirements in terms of the types of conflicts they may induce. We've identified four main categories of conflicting requirements:

1. Functional Redundancy - Components or services perform the same function, making one functionally redundant.
2. Strategy Clash - Requirements pull the system in different strategic directions in terms of the system goal, requirements are often in conflict when they concern multiple system aspects and must be balanced against each other.
3. Scalability & Quality - Requirements of high quality may impose performance and/or cost overheads and thereby undermine the overall system scalability.
4. Requirement Conflict - Requirements that cancel each other or need tradeoffs for realization.

.

Another useful application for this type of technique is in the field of medical diagnosis. For example, consider a diagnostic system that has to categorize a patient based on symptoms, lifestyle, and family history as either Diabetic or Non-Diabetic. Suppose the system gets the following information: The patient has a family history of diabetes, is overweight, and is above 45 but below 54 years old. The applicable rules for this diagnostic system are:

1. If the patient is over 54 years old, they are diabetic (Rule A).

2. If the patient is overweight or underweight, they are more likely to be diabetic (Rule B).

3. If the patient has a family history of diabetes, they are more likely to be diabetic (Rule C).

We can use the rule-based approach to categorize the patient:

Here are some interesting cases between conflict scenarios we observed during discussion with experts from the field: 1. Weight: Lightweight materials with reduced frame stiffness may affect durability concerns. 2. Frame Geometry: A design with excellent aerodynamics may not be easy to maneuver, which may negatively impact safety and ease of use. 3. Electrical Integration: Integrating an electric assist system may affect the bike's overall balance and require modifications to the frame. The goal here is not to quantitatively compare the above examples but to demonstrate the potential applicability and variety of conflict scenarios in a bicycle design.

### Proposed Solution Description

To remedy the noted challenges and dependencies among bicycle components, we propose a basic conflict resolution framework, consisting of a modular structural framework, variable geometric design, and physics-based simulation tool.

#### Modular Framework

Modularity is a key aspect to achieve flexibility in bike"
The bike should have a storage compartment for a full-size helmet.,The bike must have a top speed of 120 km/h.,Other,"Conflict between helmet storage capacity and top speed requirements. The bike's design capacity may need to be reconsidered to accommodate both a full-size helmet and a top speed of 120 km/h.

Now, let us look at the implementation of this model using Python and spaCy (version 3.2.5).

1. In this example, we'll work with the ""requirements"" domain, but you can modify it to work with other domains as desired. First, create a dataset (datasets.csv) for this domain:

   - requirement1,helmet storage compartment
   - requirement1,top speed
   - requirement2,120 km/h
   - requirement3,full-size helmet

2. Install necessary packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Initialize the legal AI model:
```
natural_language_parser/models/get_model.py
```

4. Analyze requirements conflict:
```
python requirements_analysis.py
```

5. Within the train() function in requirements",Requires manual review
The bike should have a storage compartment for a full-size helmet.,The vehicle design should be compact and lightweight.,Other,Compactness and Lightweight Vehicle Design vs. Storage Requirement,"Consider reducing the size of the storage compartment for the helmet, or design a more compact lightweight helmet to store. This could maintain the compactness and lightweight of the vehicle while still providing storage for a full-size helmet.

## Answer (0)

Consider designing a bike with a Modular Design and Make. Use a standard Size for the Frame, Wheels and Seat but have different parts of the bike to be selectable to increase the storage space. The light-weight parts of the bike can be easily be made removable and fixed with just a few bolts.

The storage compartments are a modular design. Example: front bucket, seat padding, rear basket, chain guard, leg rests and foot rests etc. The storage compartments will have to be smaller, but they will offer the flexibility to be detached and their consumption related to usage alone.

This allows for creating multiple designs within the same framework.

Just remember that storage compartments will also attract extra weight. The solution offers various configurations to maximize on the positives of each design whilst minimizing on the weakness"

The bike should have a storage compartment for a full-size helmet.,The vehicle should support fast charging to reach 80% in 30 minutes.,Other,"The storage compartment is likely to compromise the vehicle's aerodynamics, affecting performance and charging efficiency.","Consider integrating a lightweight, foldable helmet or providing a separate helmet compartment (not part of the vehicle body).

Analysis: Correct,, the suggested resolutions are valid ways to address the conflict. The first solution focuses on finding a lightweight and foldable solution for the helmet, thus minimizing its impact on the vehicle's aerodynamics. The second solution separates the helmet and the vehicle, which might be more convenient for users but may increase the overall weight and complexity of the bike. Both solutions are reasonable and depend on the design philosophy and target user group for the bike.
