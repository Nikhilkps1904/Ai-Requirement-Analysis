Requirement_1,Requirement_2,Conflict_Type,Conflict_Reason
unintended acclerations,The vehicle should be extremely lightweight for easy handling.,Safety Conflict,"Reducing vehicle weight can compromise safety systems and structural integrity, potentially worsening the effects of unintended acceleration."
unintended acclerations,Offer a very plush and comfortable suspension for long rides.,Performance Conflict,"A plush suspension, prioritizing comfort, may compromise the car's ability to quickly and safely respond to unintended accelerations."
unintended acclerations,The manufacturing cost should be kept as low as possible.,Cost Conflict,"Implementing safety measures to prevent unintended accelerations, like redundant systems and advanced sensors, increases manufacturing costs."
unintended acclerations,Design a very sleek and aerodynamic body.,Performance Conflict,A very sleek and aerodynamic body might make it more challenging to immediately stop unintended accelerations.
unintended acclerations,The vehicle should have a high-performance engine with maximum power output.,Performance Conflict,A high-performance engine can increase the risk of unintended accelerations due to its responsiveness and power.
unintended acclerations,Incorporate a large and vibrant digital instrument cluster with numerous features.,Risk Conflict,"A feature-rich digital instrument cluster, with potential software complexity, could increase the risk of unintended accelerations due to software bugs or errors."
unintended acclerations,Minimize the number of electronic aids to reduce complexity and cost.,Performance Conflict,Reducing electronic aids might make it harder to implement and control systems that prevent unintended accelerations.
unintended acclerations,The design should prioritize maximum storage capacity.,Safety Conflict,"Maximizing storage capacity might lead to a less aerodynamic design or increased weight, potentially hindering braking performance and contributing to unintended accelerations."
unintended acclerations,The design should be as minimalist as possible.,Safety Conflict,Minimizing design may lead to less robust safety features to prevent unintended acceleration.
unintended acclerations,The headlight design should be very small and integrated for aesthetics.,Performance Conflict,"Making headlights very small and integrated might compromise their light output or visibility, potentially contributing to accidents."
unintended acclerations,Offer a wide range of customization options for the customers.,Risk Conflict,Extensive customization could introduce vulnerabilities and increase the risk of unintended accelerations due to software or hardware incompatibilities.
unintended acclerations,Keep the design very standardized to reduce manufacturing complexity.,Performance Conflict,"Preventing unintended accelerations may require specialized components or more rigorous testing, potentially increasing manufacturing complexity and deviating from standardization."
unintended acclerations,The vehicle should be designed to accommodate off-road tires.,Performance Conflict,"Off-road tires, with their increased rolling resistance and potential for higher center of gravity, can exacerbate unintended accelerations."
unintended acclerations,Keep the technology simple and avoid complex electronics.,Performance Conflict,Addressing unintended accelerations often requires sophisticated electronic systems that contradict the simplicity requirement.
unintended acclerations,The vehicle should have a very high ground clearance.,Performance Conflict,"A very high ground clearance can negatively affect vehicle stability, potentially exacerbating unintended accelerations."
unintended acclerations,Design the vehicle for easy and low-cost maintenance.,Design Conflict,"Implementing fail-safe mechanisms to prevent unintended accelerations can increase the complexity of the vehicle and its maintenance procedures, thus making them more difficult and potentially costly."
unintended acclerations,Incorporate high-performance components that may require more frequent maintenance.,Performance Conflict,High-performance components are more likely to experience unintended accelerations if not properly designed and implemented.
unintended acclerations,The overall weight of the vehicle should be minimized.,Performance Conflict,Reducing vehicle weight can compromise the ability to control sudden unintended accelerations due to reduced inertia and potential for easier disturbance.
unintended acclerations,Avoid adding any unnecessary accessories to keep the cost down.,Cost Conflict,"Preventing unintended accelerations might necessitate safety features, potentially adding accessories and increasing cost."
unintended acclerations,The vehicle should be extremely fuel-efficient/energy-efficient.,Design Conflict,"Implementing extremely fuel-efficient systems (e.g., lightweighting, lean engine) can potentially compromise safety features needed to prevent unintended accelerations."
unintended acclerations,The vehicle should offer exhilarating acceleration.,Safety Conflict,Exhilarating acceleration can increase the risk of unintended accelerations and potential loss of control.
