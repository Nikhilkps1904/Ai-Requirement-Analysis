The vehicle must achieve a fuel efficiency of at least 50 km/l.,The vehicle must meet Euro 6 emission standards.,Other,"Fuel efficiency and Emission standards are inversely related. To achieve high fuel efficiency, the vehicle should be optimized for low weight, aerodynamics, and efficient engine, which are factors known to increase exhaust emissions. To meet Euro 6 emission standards, the vehicle should be equipped with technology to reduce exhaust emissions. A compromise solution could be to use a hybrid or electric vehicle that combines high energy efficiency with advanced emission control technology. Alternatively, the client could reconsider the fuel efficiency target in light of emission standards or consider using alternative fuels that have lower emission intensity.",Requires manual review,Material Conflict
